This Code fucking sucks holy hell

p.s im rewriting it now :)

I think that i am gonna stop the project here 


i would love to continue with it but im getting a little burnt out and this project started as a simple thing to run terminal commands and as i
added features i just tacked code on and it's starting to look like a jumbled mess and i hate it

im still gonna use this for every project because its still a useful piece of software 

im gonna use it for about a month or so then im gonna come back and completly re do the project as well as fix any bugs that i come across during that time
